Create a script to run Snakemake Create variables to run a snakemake_config file Create rules for three scenarios Use script to invoke Snakemake Manifest Files \u00b6 Manifest files have already been created in the /snakemake_tutorial/manifest directory.

Advanced Commands. All edits should be completed in the /snakemake_tutorial/pipeline_todo/ directory. A. Pre-Processing \u00b6 Create two different Snakemake commands, one for a dry run and one for a local run to the run_snakemake.sh Include the path to the workflow/Snakefile, the config/snakemake_config.yaml Include flags --printshellcmds, --verbose, --rerun-incomplete B. Sample Handling \u00b6 Create the parameters in the config/snakemake_config.yaml 'sampleManifest' which gives the path of the sampleManifest 'out_dir' which gives the path to the output dir (must exist) 'data_dir' which gives the path to the data dir found under \"/snakemake_tutorial/data/\" Create the sample dictionaries and project lists from the manifest in the workflow/Snakefile `CreateSampleDicts` creates a dictionary matching sample_id to filename `CreateProjLists` creates a project lists `sp_list` which contains all sample_ids and `file_list` which contains all filenames C. Create rules \u00b6 Create rule_all for each rule one at a time in the workflow/Snakefile . Perform dry runs and complete runs between each rule creation. Rule A input files should be {sample_id}.fq output should be {sample_id}_rulea.txt and should be output to the out_dir shell command should add a line \"ruleA completed\" to the original file Rule B input files should be get_input_files this definition will look up the name of the fq by taking in the sample_id as a wildcard, and using the samp_dict output should be {sample_id}_ruleb.txt and should be output to the out_dir shell command should add a line \"ruleB completed\" to the original file Rule C input files should be all of Rule B's output files output should be merged.txt and should be output to the out_dir params should be def get_rulec_cmd which iterates through all samples and creates a command cat {sample1}_ruleb.txt >> {final_file}; cat {sample2}_ruleb.txt >> {final_file} shell command should run the cmd_rulec parameter D. Advanced commands \u00b6 Add features to the run_snakemake.sh file to include check if the output dir is created; if not create it copy the snakemake_config.yaml file to the output dir; run this file for all snakemake runs update the snakemake_config.yaml file with the output_dir given from the command line update the snakemake_config.yaml file with the pipeline_dir based on the invocation of the pipeline Hints / Reminders \u00b6 Rule A and rule B are using the same input files, but only differ in how these files are being referenced. There are times when the sample_id of an input file will match, but other times (as when taking in a multiplexed ID when they will not be the same). Rule A handles cases where they match, rule B handles cases where they would not match.
